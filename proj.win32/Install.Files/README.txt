Here are extra files you might need if your game crashes on startup.

If you have a 32-bit system, copy the files in the 32-bit folder into the same directory as the game executable.

Then run vc_redist.x86.exe and install. Once installation is complete, try running the game again.

If you have a 64-bit system, copy the files in the 64-bit folder into the same directory as the game executable.

Then run vc_redist.x64.exe and install. Once installation is complete, try running the game again.
