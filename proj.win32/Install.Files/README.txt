FOR 32-BIT SYSTEMS

If you have a 32-bit system, copy the files in the 32-bit folder into the same directory as the game executable.

Then run vc_redist.x86.exe and install. Once installation is complete, try running the game again.If when you
try to install vc_redist.x86.exe a window appears that only has Modify, Uninstall, and Cancel/Close as options,
then you already have it installed and can simply close that window and run the game.

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================================================

1. I cannot connect to the server / client crashes right when I enter the game and try to move.

If you are trying to play on the same computer that the server is on, make sure you use the IP address 127.0.0.1
at the game login screen.

If you are trying to connect to a host that is on the same network but not the same computer (i.e. a different
computer in the same house, building, institution) then have the computer where the server is located run the
command prompt and then type "ipconfig". A lot of information should be displayed and to the right of the line
that says IPv4 Address should be an IP address. Have the client type that IP address at the game login screen.

Make sure whoever is hosting the server has provided you with their IP address and that it is correct. Make sure
at the screen where you put in the IP address that it is written correctly.

If you still cannot connect, make sure whoever is hosting the server has forwarded port 10001. This is typically
done through the router web interface. To learn how to forward ports, type into google the name and model of the
host router along with the words "port forwarding".
