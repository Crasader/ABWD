if you remember back at IEEE, there was a little girl who
tried to play our game and got adorably frustrated

that got me thinking about how to curve the difficulty of the game
to avoid that but there really wasn't a simple solution

to that end i want to change the direction of our difficulty 
setup which is simply getting wiped

the current problem is that sam won't promote interesting
gameplay as it goes on as is evidenced from the accursed walk
when it comes to the walk, there is actually nothing i can
come up with to make it more interesting

my proposals
1. we remove the painting erasing as the default
this should be something extreme and not the norm
it doesn't really make sense and it's more frustrating
than it is challenging

i would instead like to make all obstacles based on
disruption as the primary focus
so for example, ptera would have a few personal behaviors
first is the old stun idea where tera slams you away and takes your
paintbrush forcing you to retrieve it
second, ptera will carry around a small paint can which will
recolor the players paintbrush to a random color
more later

we can always increase the difficulty by adding the old method later

2. seperate entities
currently only 1 action runs at a time and it runs through
a behavior from sam like the whistling
this is totally adorable and i love it but its stagnant
they can't cooperate like this which makes less unique gameplay
i want to let every entity run concurrently so they make
obnoxious maneuvers


3. sam is the supplement element to the challenge
sam's power can't be overbearing or it overshadows
all the other items we introduce
and if she is powerful why bring in others?
i want to make sam what she is supposed to be to the player
and that is an annoying twerp
when she chases you and catches you this is the slow down
in this example, ptera is the dangerous one who really affects you
sam will just hug your leg hampering your speed but this lets
ptera do the damage

another thing is that she might throw paintballs at players randomly 
assigning a color if it hits

4. playing with sam
sams out to have fun so that should be an option
this would be associated with some secret ending
so ill leave this to later discussion

5. we need a story

6. weak swarms or powerful individuals
theres a couple design flows we can follow
the first is the current though model where
we have a single powerful creature accompany sam throughout each area
another option im throwing out is that each creature
is excessively weak in impact, but they don't stop existing

so ptera is a very weak creature not doing much,
but suddenly we add the low impact trex,
the low impact walrus,
low impact flying shark
and now the game is hectic
of course we would need to include ways to remove
creatures overtime, maybe by playing with sam
she will remove some of the creatures
